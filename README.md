# FIPtool

## Update 2023-03-29

FIP decided to overhaul its website, breaking basically everything that I made for this tool. I have no plans on updating this for the new website, because I honestly do not want to bother with it. (furthermore, the website is atrocious and should be ashamed of itself)
I'll leave this tool on GitHub in case anyone wants to fork it and adapt it to the new version.

## Description

This is a tool for querying the [Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro](https://www.fip.it/) "API".

Since the website is clunky and does not provide a good way to query the API, I created this tool. It is still in development, but it is usable.

To get started, install any version of Python (3.7 or later) and make sure you have a Bash shell available. Then either `cd` into the `bin` folder, or add it to your PATH. The syntax is under construction, and can be obtained by running `fip --help`.
