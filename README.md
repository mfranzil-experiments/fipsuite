# FIPtool

This is a tool for querying the [Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro](https://www.fip.it/) "API".

Since the website is clunky and does not provide a good way to query the API, I created this tool. It is still in development, but it is usable.

To get started, install any version of Python (3.7 or later) and make sure you have a Bash shell available. Then either `cd` into the `bin` folder, or add it to your PATH. The syntax is under construction, and can be obtained by running `fip --help`.
